## About this forks

This repository is a customized version of the static site generator "Zola," featuring unique modifications to its source code that alter how URLs are generated.

The original Zola generates what are known as "pretty URLs," which end with a trailing slash (e.g., /about/). On most web servers, a request to such a URL implicitly returns the /about/index.html file. However, this "directory indexing" feature may not work with certain hosting services or server configurations, preventing pages from being displayed correctly.

The original Zola lacks a built-in configuration option to append index.html to URLs to work around this problem.

This fork, therefore, modifies the source code directly. Instead of generating pretty URLs, its specification has been altered to always produce URLs that explicitly include index.html at the end (e.g., /about/index.html). This approach ensures that links to pages are reliable across any environment, independent of server behavior.

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

To find out more see the [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), look
in the [docs/content](docs/content) folder of this repository or visit the [Zola community forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and its template engine [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.
